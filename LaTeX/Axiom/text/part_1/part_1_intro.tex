\part{The Foundation}
\chapter{Introduction}
As mentioned in the preface, this section is made to axiomatically develop the foundations needed. 

To illustrate, in order to develop physical theories, mathematics must be developed, a philosophy of science must be made, metaphysics, epistemology, and formal logic. Thus, a complete theory of all of these things and more should be created. One that has fundamental, expressible axioms. 

Also, most of these theories rely on one another, so a logical chronology must be defined. At the moment of writing this it is defined to be logic $\to$ metaphysics $\to$ Epistemology$\to$ philosophy of science $\to$
philosophy of physics $\to$ mathematics $\to$ physics $\to$  theology $\to$ ethics $\to$ social philosophy $\to$ personal philosophy.

One additional thing to add, you may notice the separation of metaphysics and the philosophy of physics. These are both meant to signify a difference where metaphysics represents extremely fundamental questions like does existence exist. Things that must be answered before epistemology can be fully introduced. The next section, philosophy of physics, are slightly less fundamental, like the ontology of entropy. Questions that require a theory of epistemology to be answered.
