* Plans
My current plan, is to set weeks(or however long it takes to complete) with a theme.

With a:
- Coding Project
- Reading Book
- Mathematical/Physics Project/Paper reading
- Writing on my own ideas

Here is what I am thinking to my first set:

** Set 1
- Coding: Simple Lie Poisson reduction for orbit
- Reading: Continue reading Numerical Hamiltonian Problems
- Math: Derive Noether's Theorem for Hamiltonian Mechanics
- Writing: Metaphysics of Noether's Theorem
** Set 2:
? I will figure it out later

More ideas:

Coding:
- Compare Metriplectic to traditional Resistive-MHD
        - Check things like error, CPU time, etc
- Omega-X
        - Develop SymPy to check Jacobi Identity and degenercy

Math:
- Entropy as a geometric quantity
- Hamiltonian/Other SuperNova
