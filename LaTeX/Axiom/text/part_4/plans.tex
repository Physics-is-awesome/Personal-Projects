\subsection{Self-Education}
elf-education has always been a great value of mine. As mentioned earlier, I became obsessed with learning Einstein's field equation in 3-4th grade. Beyond that I have spent much of my time reading books, watching YouTube videos, and more about topics that interest me. Though, late in 8th grade, this desire to teach myself grew a great deal. Before I can go about my future goals for teaching myself I must first go over what I have already down.(This list is not full, mainly lectures finished and books from lectures, this does not include books not finished, non-lecture based video education, research papers read, projects where I learned things for the project alone, and other similar programs)
