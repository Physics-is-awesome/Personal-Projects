\section{1/9/2026 Essay: Cultivation in Degregation}

As mentioned in previous chapters, the development of virtue stands at the cornerstone of the existence of man. Thus, how to develop it is key.

The question of how to develop virtue, what virtues to develop, etc; differ from person to person. I will focus on myself for this essay, on a practical development, rather than in the abstract general
way I would traditionally go for.

Specifically, I will focus on my recent 'degregation' in many fields. What I mean is I have been struggling with health problems that caused constant pain, nausea, and brain fog.
To combate this I used "quick" and "automatic" gratification. Watched lots and lots, of Instagram videos and YouTube shorts. With quick and simple comedy TV in the background.
While it is difficult to divide what is caused by using these simple causes of gratification and what is caused by my still recovering body, but I am having trouble focusing, get tired easily,
less intrinsically motivated, and other similar malignities.
