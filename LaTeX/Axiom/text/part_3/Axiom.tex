\subsection{Division of Structure}
In this program I have used this structure to divide the book up:
\begin{verbatim}
    \part{}
    \chapter{}
    \section{}
    \subsection{}
    \subsubsection{}
    \subsubsubsection{} % custom made
    \paragraph
    \subparagraph
\end{verbatim}
I may have to learn new ways to divide in the future, but I will try to aviod that.
\subsection{Commands}
Here are some commands that I will have here for reference:
\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{verbatim} writes things exactly, used mostly 
    for writing LaTeX commands in this method
    \label{} → Set a reference point
    \ref{} → Refer to numbered items

    \pageref{} → Refer to page number

    \nameref{} (requires hyperref) → Refer to name/title 
    of chapter/section

    \autoref{} (requires hyperref) → Smart referencing 
    (automatically adds “Chapter”, “Section”)
    \begin{equation} ... \end{equation} → Numbered 
    equations

    \[ ... \] → Displayed, unnumbered equations

    $ ... $ → Inline math

    \frac{a}{b}, \sqrt{x}, \sum, \int → Standard 
    math symbols

    \begin{align} ... \end{align} (from amsmath) 
    → Multi-line aligned equations

    \begin{cases} ... \end{cases} → Piecewise functions

    \bra{}, \ket{}, \braket{} → 
    Use physics package for quantum notation

    \tensor{} → Use tensor package 
    for tensor indices

    \dv{}, \pdv{} → Derivatives (from physics)
    \begin{figure}[h!] ... \end{figure} → 
    Insert figures

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{file}
    → Image inclusion (graphicx)

    \caption{} / \label{} → Caption and reference

    \begin{table}[h!] ... \end{table} → Tables
\end{verbatim}

I also have begin\{lstlisting\} to write both FORTRAN and make. I will likely add python and Julia
