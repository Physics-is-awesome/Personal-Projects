\section{Brainstorm}

I had thought of a couple of ideas, but had forgot to write them down. I guess I will just explain my final one.

My plan is to have it so it can parse one of my daily org files for a schedule, then can paste that schedule into the website to view. I would
like to allow for checking things off, in progress, notes, and some other things I will get into at a later point.

I would also like to access my book easily through the website
