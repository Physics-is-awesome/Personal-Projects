\section{Assumptions of Physics}

\subsection{Overview}
The overall goal is to explore the minimal set of physical assumptions are necessary and sufficient to derive different theories within a
unified framework. This is almost identical to my Axiom project with the exeption that while not as broad their research is much deeper than mine.

It is broken into two parts

\textbf{Reverse Physics}: Looks at the main theories and finding the common and the different aspects of those theories.

\textbf{Physical Mathematics}: Connecting physical objects and theories to be mapped onto the correct mathematical objects

\subsection{Reverse Physics}

\subsubsection{Classical Mechanics}


\subsubsubsection{Inequivalence of formulations}
